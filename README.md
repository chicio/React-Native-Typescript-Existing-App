[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chicio/React-Native-Typescript-Existing-App/master/LICENSE.md)

An example project in which I show how it is possible to use React Native + TypeScript in an existing app.. This is a
 project for my blog post [React Native + Typescript :purple_heart:, love at first sight. Setup in an existing app.](https://www.fabrizioduroni.it/2018/04/07/react-native-typescript-existing-app.html "React Native + Typescript :purple_heart:, love at first sight. Setup in an existing app") 

### Description

This repository contains an example of an app that contains native code and React Native + TypeScript code. This is a
 quote from the post:

> ......What does it means? It means that TypeScript is basically *"Javascript on steroid"*: it provides optional, 
static type checking at compile time. Since it is a superset of JavaScript, all JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code. 
  TypeScript is useful if you are a developer that comes from other strongly typed language and with a strong knowledge
   of Object Oriented programming because it let you reuse a lot of the programming technique you already know.  
   React Native officially support Javascript. So how can we setup React Native + Typescript? In this post we will see 
   how to integrate React Native and Typescript in an existing app and we will add a new screen done in React Native 
   where we will show the photo of the day that we will read from the Nasa open API.......
